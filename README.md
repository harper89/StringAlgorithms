# String Algorithm Challenges

This assignment contains five classic String-processing challenges. Each one is designed to help you develop confidence with character access, substring handling, and building simple algorithms with loops and conditional logic.

Submit as many challenges as you can complete to a repository named **`StringAlgorithms`**.  
All of your work should be done in a single file named **`StringAlgorithms.java`**, which must also include a **`main`** method that tests each algorithm at least once.

---

## ✔️ Challenge 1 — `printCharacters`
Write a method **`printCharacters`** that takes a `String word` as a parameter.  
The method should **return a single String** where **each character of `word` appears on its own line**.

**Example:**  
`printCharacters("cat")` →  

---

## ✔️ Challenge 2 — 'reverseWord'
Write a method **'reverseWord'** that takes a 'String word' as a parameter.  
The method should **return a new String with the characters reversed**.

**Example:**  
'reverseWord("hello")' → '"olleh"'

---

## ✔️ Challenge 3 — 'capitalizeString'
Write a method **'capitalizeString'** that takes a 'String sentence' as a parameter.  
The method should **return a new String in which the first letter of every word is capitalized**, leaving the rest of the letters unchanged.

**Example:**  
'capitalizeString("the quick brown fox")' → '"The Quick Brown Fox"'

---

## ✔️ Challenge 4 — 'detectPalindrome'
Write a method **'detectPalindrome'** that takes a 'String word' as a parameter.  
The method should **return 'true' if the word reads the same forward and backward** (ignoring case), and **'false' otherwise**.

**Example:**  
- 'detectPalindrome("Racecar")' → 'true'  
- 'detectPalindrome("Java")' → 'false'

---

## ✔️ Challenge 5 — 'firstUniqueChar'
Write a method **'firstUniqueChar'** that takes a 'String word' and returns the **first character that appears exactly once** in that String.  
If no such character exists, return a space '' '' (or another sentinel value of your choice).

**Examples:**  
- 'firstUniqueChar("swiss")' → ''w''  
- 'firstUniqueChar("aabbcc")' → '' ''  

---

## 📦 Submission Requirements

- Submit your work to a GitHub repository named **'StringAlgorithms'**.  
- All code must be contained in a single file named **'StringAlgorithms.java'**.  
- Your file must include a **'main'** method that tests each of the challenges at least once.

Happy coding!

**Grading Rubric:**
You are required to complete at least two of these challenges. If you finish two before our class time is up, please continue working on further challenges.
